# Password Generator - Module 3 Challenge

## Description

This Password Generator Webpage was created for boot camp students practicing JavaScript. The starter code was provided and the students were instructed to make the webpage functional. In order to generate a secure password, the students needed to ask the user to provide the desired character length and confirm which criteria the user wanted to include in the password. Please see User Story and Acceptance Criteria below: 

User Story: 

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the Password Generator, click on the Generate Password button.

 A prompt will appear, which is where you will enter your desired password length. If the amount entered is not a number, an error alert will pop-up. If the amount entered is a number but not within the criteria range of 8-128, an alert will notify you of the acceptance criteria range. 

 Once you have entered a number between 8-128, you will be asked additional questions regarding the types of characters you would like to include in your password. If you select at least one of the character options, your password will be generated and displayed in the Secure Password textbox.
